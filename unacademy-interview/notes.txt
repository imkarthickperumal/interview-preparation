Question 1 : map vs forEach

map()     : map() method create new array
forEach() : forEach() method dosen't create new array basesd on the given array

map()     : map() method returns the newly created array according to the provieded callback function
forEach() : forEach() method returns "undefined"

map()     : It does not change the orginal array
forEach() : It is not executed for empty elements


// Question 2 : null vs undefined

null      : The value of represents the any object value 
undefined : The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been declared 


// Question 3 : Event Deligation 
Event Deligation : Event Deligation is basically pattern to handle event efficiently. we can add
                   an event listener to a parent element and call an event on particular target.
